## Key Research Findings

### 1. Structured Prompting Frameworks

#### **CO-STAR Framework**
**Components**: Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response format
**Application to Planning**:
```json
{
  "context": "Background information about the project and current state",
  "objective": "Specific task or goal to accomplish", 
  "style": "Technical, precise, step-by-step",
  "tone": "Professional, cautious, thorough",
  "audience": "Senior developers executing complex migrations",
  "response": "Structured JSON with validation criteria"
}
```

#### **Prompt Structure Components**
**Essential Elements**:
- **Instruction**: Specific task description
- **Context**: Additional information to guide response
- **Input Data**: Expressed as input or question
- **Examples**: Few-shot learning patterns
- **Constraints**: Explicit limitations and requirements

### 2. Advanced Reasoning Techniques

#### **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
**Purpose**: Foster coherent and step-by-step reasoning
**Application**: Breaking complex tasks into logical sequences

**Example Implementation**:
```json
{
  "task": "Port ConnectionManager from reference",
  "reasoning_chain": [
    "1. Analyze reference ConnectionManager interface and dependencies",
    "2. Identify integration points with existing SecretsManager",
    "3. Determine minimal interface requirements for testability", 
    "4. Implement adaptation layer between reference and existing code",
    "5. Validate integration works with existing authentication"
  ]
}
```

#### **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Framework**
**Purpose**: Enable exploration and look-ahead reasoning
**Application**: Complex decisions with multiple viable approaches

**Example Structure**:
```json
{
  "decision_point": "How to handle BigQuery connection management",
  "thoughts": [
    {
      "approach": "Connection pooling",
      "reasoning": "Better performance, resource efficiency",
      "risks": ["Complexity", "Configuration overhead"],
      "evaluation": 7
    },
    {
      "approach": "Per-request connections", 
      "reasoning": "Simpler implementation, matches reference",
      "risks": ["Performance impact", "Resource usage"],
      "evaluation": 8
    }
  ],
  "selected": "Per-request connections",
  "rationale": "MVP approach prioritizes simplicity over optimization"
}
```

#### **Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) Framework**
**Purpose**: Handle non-linear thought processes with dynamic interaction
**Application**: Complex systems with interdependent components

**Features**:
- Dynamic interaction between ideas
- Backtracking and revision capabilities  
- Aggregation of parallel reasoning paths
- Circular dependency resolution

### 3. Memory and Context Management

#### **Memory Types for LLMs**
1. **Short-term Memory**: Context information via in-context learning
2. **Long-term Memory**: Past behaviors via external vector stores

#### **Context Length Challenges**
**Problem**: LLMs have limited context windows
**Solutions**:
- **Hierarchical Context**: Layer information by importance
- **Context Compression**: Summarize non-essential information
- **Context Inheritance**: Pass only relevant information between phases
- **Context Refresh**: Reload essential context when needed

#### **Memory Formats**
- **Natural Language**: Human-readable descriptions
- **Embeddings**: Vector representations for similarity search
- **Databases**: Structured storage for factual information
- **Structured Lists**: Organized hierarchical information

### 4. Reliability and Error Recovery

#### **Common LLM Agent Challenges**
- **Prompt Sensitivity**: Small changes can cause dramatic performance differences
- **Long-term Planning**: Context limitations affect multi-step reasoning
- **Error Propagation**: Early mistakes compound throughout execution
- **Context Drift**: Important information gets lost over time

#### **Reliability Patterns**
1. **Validation Checkpoints**: Regular verification of progress
2. **Rollback Mechanisms**: Ability to undo failed steps
3. **Context Refresh**: Periodic reloading of essential information
4. **Error Recovery**: Structured approaches to handling failures

### 5. Cognitive Load Management

#### **Information Hierarchy Principles**
1. **Primary**: Current task requirements and immediate context
2. **Secondary**: Dependencies and validation criteria  
3. **Tertiary**: Background information and broader context
4. **Reference**: Available for lookup but not actively processed

#### **Prompt Order Effects**
**Research Finding**: Order of elements significantly affects AI processing
**Best Practice**: Place directive/question last to maintain focus
**Example**:
```
[Context] â†’ [Background] â†’ [Constraints] â†’ [Examples] â†’ [Specific Task]
```

#### **Context Window Optimization**
- **Relevance Filtering**: Include only information needed for current task
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually
- **Chunking**: Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Reference Linking**: Point to external context rather than embedding

## Best Practices for LLM Planning

- Enable self-correction through feedback loops
- Include confidence thresholds for decision points

### 4. **Reasoning Enhancement**
- Include explicit reasoning chains for complex decisions
- Provide alternative approaches for critical tasks
- Enable look-ahead reasoning for dependencies
- Support backtracking for failed approaches

### 5. **Error Handling and Recovery**
- Anticipate common failure modes
- Provide specific recovery procedures
- Include rollback triggers and procedures
- Enable graceful degradation of complex plans

## Framework Comparison Analysis

### Current Planning Format vs. Research

| Framework | Current Implementation | Research Optimal | Gap Analysis |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **CO-STAR** | Partial (Context âœ“, Objective âœ“) | Full implementation | Missing Audience, Response format specification |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Task-level steps | Explicit reasoning chains | Need reasoning fields in tasks |
| **Tree-of-Thoughts** | Multiple approaches compared | Branching decision trees | Need decision point exploration |
| **Memory Management** | Phase-based context | Explicit inheritance patterns | Need context flow specifications |
| **Validation** | Checklist approach | Multi-level verification | Need structured validation chains |
