# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a research and documentation project focused on Context Engineering for LLM-driven development. It analyzes and proposes improvements to planning formats for Large Language Model agents used in software development workflows, specifically evaluating the Virgil monorepo planning format.

## Key Information

### Project Type
- **Pure documentation/research project** - No executable code
- **Primary format**: Markdown documentation (.md files)
- **Configuration format**: JSON templates and examples
- **No traditional programming languages or frameworks**

### Repository Structure
- Flat structure with all files in `/research` directory
- No subdirectories
- 10 files total: 8 Markdown documents, 2 JSON templates

### Core Documents
- `README.md` - Project overview and navigation guide
- `format-analysis.md` - Evaluation of current planning formats (rated 8.5/10)
- `context-engineering-research.md` - Academic research findings
- `recommendations.md` - Specific improvement proposals
- `best-practices.md` - Comprehensive best practices guide

### Key Research Areas
1. **Context Engineering** - Optimizing how LLMs understand and process complex planning tasks
2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Enhanced reasoning frameworks for better decision making
3. **Cognitive Load Management** - Strategies for managing LLM context and memory
4. **Validation Patterns** - Multi-level validation frameworks for execution reliability

## Working with This Repository

### Common Tasks

Since this is a documentation project, common tasks include:
- **Reading and analyzing** existing research documents
- **Updating documentation** based on new findings or feedback
- **Creating new templates** or examples in JSON format
- **Cross-referencing** between different research documents
- **Synthesizing information** from multiple sources

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, hierarchical structure in markdown files
- Include practical examples where applicable
- Maintain consistency with existing format analysis ratings and terminology
- Reference source documents when building on existing research

### JSON Template Guidelines
When working with JSON templates:
- Maintain the established structure from `enhanced-planning-template.json`
- Include comprehensive examples as shown in `task-structure-examples.json`
- Use descriptive field names that align with Context Engineering principles
- Provide clear comments or documentation for complex structures

## Context and Background

This research was conducted on July 4, 2025, analyzing the Virgil monorepo planning format which received a rating of 8.5/10. The main improvement areas identified include:
- Enhanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning at task level
- Better context inheritance between phases
- More structured validation workflows
- Cognitive load management for complex tasks

The research applies modern prompt engineering techniques including Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, and structured prompting frameworks to improve LLM-driven development workflows.
