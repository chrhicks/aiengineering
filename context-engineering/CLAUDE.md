# Context Engineering Experiment Assistant Memory

## Project Overview
I'm helping test and refine the proto-v1 context engineering system - a framework for AI-assisted software development using specialized agents, templates, and workflows.

## Key Experiment: Personal Finance Tracker
**Location**: `/proto-v1/personal_finance_tracker/`
**Purpose**: Test the complete workflow from project discovery through implementation

### Workflow Being Tested:
1. **Conversational Discovery** â†’ PROJECT-INIT.md
2. **Task Roadmap Creation** â†’ TASK-ROADMAP.md (we added this)
3. **Task Planning** â†’ Individual TASK-XXX.md files
4. **Implementation** using specialized agents
5. **Validation** with documentation updates

## Major Improvements Made to Proto-v1

### 1. Added Task Roadmap Layer
- Created `task-roadmap-template.md`
- Bridges gap between high-level phases and detailed tasks
- Provides dependency mapping and progress tracking

### 2. Enhanced Agent Usage
- Updated `task-planning-template.md` with Agent Strategy section
- Added explicit instructions for perspective switching
- Created `agent-usage-guide.md` for best practices

### 3. Workflow Discipline
- Added Implementation Checkpoints to task planning
- Updated validation template with documentation reminders
- Made execution notes REQUIRED (not optional)

## Key Learnings from Experiment

### What Worked Well:
- Project Discovery Agent created excellent PROJECT-INIT.md
- Task roadmap generation exceeded template expectations
- Technical implementation was solid when agents followed the process
- Agent adapted multi-perspective approach through sequential role-playing (simulating different agents)

### What Needed Fixing:
- Agents weren't switching perspectives during implementation â†’ FIXED with explicit switching instructions
- Task documents weren't being updated post-execution â†’ FIXED with implementation checkpoints
- Missing intermediate layer between project init and detailed tasks â†’ FIXED with task roadmap

### Agent Perspective Innovation:
- Agent developed a "sequential role-playing" approach instead of spawning sub-agents
- Uses clear "ðŸ”„ AGENT PERSPECTIVE SWITCH" announcements
- Maintains distinct voices and concerns for each perspective
- Demonstrates iterative improvement through perspective changes
- This approach maintains context while still achieving multi-perspective validation

### Proto-v1 Further Refinements (2025-07-04):
Based on PFIN-DATA-002 results:
- **Simplified agent approach**: Removed complex perspective switching in favor of validation checkpoints
- **Added supervision section**: Self-supervision checklist ensures workflow compliance
- **Enhanced documentation requirements**: More explicit about filling in all sections
- **Focus on quality through discipline**: Not theatrical role-playing
- **Key insight**: Agents prioritize "doing work" over "documenting process" without enforcement

### Current Status:
- Personal finance tracker has working foundation (Vue/Fastify/SQLite)
- PFIN-SETUP-001: Complete with full documentation and retrospective updates
- PFIN-DATA-002: Complete with repository pattern, CRUD operations, and API routes
- Ready for PFIN-IMPORT-003 (CSV Import System)

## Important Files to Remember
- `/proto-v1/` - Main templates and guides
- `/proto-v1/personal_finance_tracker/` - Active experiment
- `/proto-v1/agent-usage-guide.md` - New guide we created
- `~/.claude/projects/.../028f3fb5-e877-4a77-81e1-98b0145e71dd.jsonl` - Original discovery conversation

## Context for Future Conversations
When resuming, check:
1. Current task status in TASK-ROADMAP.md
2. Latest updates to task documents
3. Any new learnings that should be incorporated into templates

The experiment is ongoing and proving valuable for iterative improvement of the context engineering system.
